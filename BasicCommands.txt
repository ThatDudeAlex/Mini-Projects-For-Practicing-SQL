    BASIC SQL COMMANDS
    --------------------

    - SELECT: 
        This is a command that allows you to get data. It retrieves 1 or more rows, from 1 or more tables
        Example: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM contacts;

    - INSERT
        Adds 1 or more rows into a table. INSERT only works against a single table, unlike SELECT which can works against
        multiple tables.
        Example: INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name)
                    VALUES ('John', 'doe');
        IMPORTANT: 
            - 'INSERT INTO' is the full insert command

    - UPDATE
        Modifies 1 or more rows in a table
        Example: UPDATE contacts SET last_name = 'Ahern' WHERE id = 1; 
        IMPORTANT: 
            - The WHERE clause tells the UPDATE statement what is the retrisction on this update. if we dont add this, it woild 
              change the last name of all contacts.
    
    - DELETE
        Removes 1 or more rows from a table
        Example: DELETE FROM contacts WHERE id = 2;
        IMPORTANT: 
            - If we dont add the WHERE clause here, it would delete ALL! rows in our table D:
            - 'DELETE FROM' is the full delete command,
